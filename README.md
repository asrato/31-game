## About the project

A React game based on Blackjack. Instead of trying to reach 21 points, the user must reach 31, without exceeding the limit.  
I used this project to, not only practice my React and JavaScript skills, but also test my CSS mastery.

## Technologies
This projects uses:
* `npm` as package manager
* `react` as component library
* `css` as component stylizer
* `webpack` as module bundler
* `babel` as JavaScript transpiler
* `firebase` as hosting service

## Setup

Clone this repository or download the source code. You will need `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.

Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies

After that, run `npm run dev`, to run the application locally in `localhost:3080`, or `npm run build`, to generate a production build of the project.

## Status

This project's version is completed. In the future, I will implement a Player VS ComputerAI version of this game.
